The VP Operations & Finance is responsible for overseeing the Students’ Union’s 

$10.37 million budget as well as the daily operations of the Students’ Union. These two 

roles work in conjunction in hopes to tackle any concerns. The primary focus of my 

platform is to address the  North Power Plant redevelopment, provide diverse options for 

food on campus , and improve communication between the Students’ Union and the rest 

of the student body. My approach is principally a cooperative one, not an adversarial one. 

I believe cooperation with all stakeholders is the best way to achieve our common goal: 

to make a greater Student Union and thus, a better experience for all students on campus.

  I believe that every stakeholder, be it the VP OF or the University administrator, share a 

common goal : to provide a better experience for all students on campus. As such, I 

promise to approach every issue in a cooperative manner.

           As a councilor, I had the chance to take a closer look at the portfolio of each executive. 

All the portfolios had an interesting aspect to them however, Vice President Operations & 

Finance appealed to me the most. I am running not only because  I believe that I have the 

right skills and experiences to be VP Operations and Finance but, to cultivate the great 

potential the Students’ Union has in improving students’ experience on campus. 

Throughout my time on campus, I have thought of many ways in which the SU can 

improve the lives of students on campus. I would initially like to address the different 

experiences a student may face in the Winter semester versus the Fall. It appears that 

Winter Semester has a less welcoming environment in comparison to the Fall. One of my 

goals is to ensure we have a fresh start to the Winter Semester to avoid the overwhelming 

sense of being drained by the third of week of January. With that being said, I see a great 

opportunity for the SU to increase and diversify its revenues during this period by 

offering discount prices of food and beverage during these days.

                          I am currently finishing my B.A. at the University of Alberta, in Honours Economics. In 

2009, I started my own clothing business in North Edmonton, and managed it until the 

end of 2014. I also did accounting work for Shop Easy Foods from the year 2013 and 

2014. Having previous experience with accounting and financials of business, I have 

developed the essential skills for this position. I am passionate about utilizing the skills 

that I’ve learned in my academic and work career to benefit our university.

Spending one year on Students’ Council,  followed by active involvement with student 

groups like the Muslim Students Association and Sponsoring Orphans Worldwide;  I 

have had the privilege to work with the diverse communities University of Alberta has to 

offer.

				The welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere in the fall semester is not applicable to the 

beginning of winter semester. Since student groups face issues with recruiting in the 

winter semester, many students are discouraged due to reasons like shyness, an 

overwhelming class schedule from the from first semester, or even because their first 

semester at university is the Winter Semester. The Butterdome is a great place for clubs 

fairs to be held, in hopes to initiate conversations with the university as soon as my term 

begins. I plan to work in conjunction with the VP Student Life to execute this part of the 

plan. I also plan to offer lower prices for food & beverage at RATT and Dewey’s during 

this period in order to increase revenue and expose our brand.

 Overall, I have heard students complain about food and beverages quality at both places. 

It is one of my goals is to give students a great bar experience from the beginning of 

second semester.

				All students pay $105.08 per semester to the Students’ Union. Out of this sum, $38.08 

goes towards your Students’ Union membership fee, and the other $67 goes towards 

Students’ Union dedicated fees (not directly to the SU). As many students are informed, 

we pay $9 per semester for the SUB renovations and $26 per semester go towards the 

PAW fund (to subsidize the cost of the PAW centre). I believe the SU should develop a 

transparent relationship with students especially in regards to the collection and 

allocation of these fees. If elected, I plan to better inform students on the SU finances by 

sending out quarterly reports on the allocation of this money.

				The SU will be renovating Dewey’s during the process. Similar to the SUB and PAW 

centre renovations, this will be our next capital project.  The North Power Plant, where 

Dewey’s is located, was built in 1915 and originally housed the generator for South 

Edmonton, it is also the place where the first experiment to extract oil from oil sands was 

done in Alberta. The University, together with the Graduate Students’ Association and 

Students’ Union, is planning to create an Alumni Centre in the space. The Students’ 

Union main task will be to renovate our establishment in the building, Dewey’s, as a 

show room for what the entire building could be. Dewey’s has been through some rough 

times in the last few years. The current executive team has already taken steps to ensure 

Dewey’s success. I believe Dewey’s must receive special attention from the VPOF, as it 

is our only business outside of SUB. A new menu has been introduced, and the new 

manager has been taking excellent first steps to better the space. The establishment will 

be receiving a new look next year and I plan to frequently communicate with the student 

body in order to transform Dewey’s into a busier and more student friendly space.

				In order to remain relevant on campus against competitive food chains, SU businesses 

must always look into ways to innovate and diversify what it offers to students. Seeing 

how our food and beverage services lose business throughout the years due to this, the 

SU must accommodate students needs. We will need to introduce more cost efficient 

options to the students. I have gained the impression that L’Express has not been 

performing to its full potential in the last few years. I plan to introduce new halal, kosher, 

vegan, salt reduced & gluten free options at our establishments. L’Express loses business 

by not offering enough of these options for students. An increase in diversity is definitely 

needed in order to boost L’Express’ revenues.

				Students’ Union bylaws are only available in the English language creating a barrier for

to work together with AUFSJ to translate the bylaws. This will help students whose first 

language is French better communicate and understand the SU’s operations and policies.

				The TVs in SUB, Cameron, Lister & CCIS can be explored in more interesting ways. 

We must promote and take pride in our athletes since they carry our University’s name 

across the nation. I will look into the feasibility of playing the highlights of the week on 

the televisions in order to support and encourage our athletes. Another idea I wish to 

explore is the opportunity of a live newsfeed by our campus newspaper, The Gateway, to 

keep students informed about current events on campus and in the world. This will also 

give a valuable experience for our hard-working journalists. This will expand our brand 

to areas and students that we have not had much interaction with.

				The SU is constantly looking for ways to increase and diversify its revenue stream. I 

would like to create a committee ran by students that looks at ways of increasing our 

presence across campus and the city. This is an opportunity for students to work together 

with the Students’ Union in a way that benefits both parties. I believe that once 

renovations are completed in the lower level of SUB, the SU will have the opportunity to 

sell the naming rights of rooms creating a new source of revenue that did not previously 

exist. If we market ourselves correctly across the city, the SU can be one of the selling 

points as to why an individual would choose the University of Alberta, thus increasing 

our revenue through student enrollment.

				Similar to what is done in the United States where menus provide information on the 

calories that each item contains, I believe that a great step towards a healthier campus is 

to provide this information for all items sold at an SU business. Through this, our 

businesses gain credibility with the student body, which may yield to an increase market 

share and an increase in revenues. Expanding this idea across campus is definitely 

something to consider in the near future.
